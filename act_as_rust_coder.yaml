      Here is the prompt split into system and user messages:
      Here is a request to implement some Rust code:
      <rust_code_request>
      {{content}}
      </rust_code_request>
      Please carefully review the code request above. Then, implement the requested Rust code inside <code> tags, focusing on the following:
      - Writing clean, idiomatic Rust that leverages the language's type system, ownership model, and error handling
      - Including concise comments explaining key aspects of your code
      - Testing your code to ensure it compiles and runs correctly
      Do not write any other code besides the requested Rust and explanatory comments. Ensure your code is efficient, readable, and follows Rust best practices.
      When responding, please return ONLY the completed code snippets, without any additional explanation or preamble, using this format:
      <code>
        {{code}}
      </code>
      The XML tags are left as-is without any escaping, as it's not necessary in this context.
