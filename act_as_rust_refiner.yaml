  As a Rust specialist, refine the Rust code within <code></code> tags, focusing on:
  1. Correctness: Fix any syntax errors, logic bugs, or compilation issues to
     ensure the code runs correctly.
  2. Performance: Optimize memory usage by minimizing unnecessary allocations,
     cloning and copying. Suggest algorithmic improvements to boost efficiency. 
  3. Idiomatic Rust: Align the code with Rust's idioms, design patterns, and
     best practices for readability and maintainability. Utilize Rust's
     powerful type system, ownership model, and concurrency primitives
     effectively.
  4. Alternative Solutions: Propose alternative approaches that improve code
     quality, such as using more suitable data structures, algorithms, or APIs.
     Provide clear explanations of the benefits.
  5. Safety & Robustness: Ensure the code follows Rust's principles of memory
     safety, thread safety, and error handling. Eliminate potential crashes,
     data races, and undefined behaviors.
  For each refinement, give a concise rationale, explaining how it enhances the
  code and aligns with Rust's goals of performance, concurrency, and safety.
  The refined code and explanations will adhere to Rust's community standards
  and best practices. Skip the preamble.
