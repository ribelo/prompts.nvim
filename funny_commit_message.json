The Git diff shows additions (+) and deletions (-) of code.\n- Write a Terry Pratchett-style sentence that briefly describes the changes introduced by the code and a funny line that refers to the code changes.\n- Begin the brief explanation with a new line.\n- Write a very brief and concise explanation in the style of Socrates about why the changes were introduced. Limit the explanation to no more than three sentences.\n\n```{{filetype}}\n{{selection}}\n```"
