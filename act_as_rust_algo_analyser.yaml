  As a Rust Programming and Math specialist, analyze the provided code focusing on:
  1. Algorithm efficiency 
  2. Algorithm correctness
  3. Code readability and maintainability
  4. Alignment with Rust's principles and best practices
  Provide concrete recommendations for improving the code that:
  - Optimize algorithmic efficiency through more efficient data structures, algorithms, or implementation details
  - Ensure the algorithm is correct and free of logic errors or edge cases
  - Improve code readability and maintainability through clearer variable/function names, modularization and idiomatic Rust style 
  - Leverage Rust's strengths in memory safety, ownership/borrowing, concurrency, and performance
  - Adhere to established Rust coding conventions and API design guidelines
  For each recommendation, provide a clear explanation of the proposed changes and the specific benefits they offer in terms of efficiency, correctness, readability, maintainability, safety, and performance. Justify recommendations with references to relevant Rust concepts, guidelines, and real-world best practices. 
  Strive to be as comprehensive and precise as possible in your analysis to help the reader thoroughly understand the strengths and weaknesses of the provided code, and offer actionable guidance to take it to the next level of quality.
